1. This project follows a Test Driven Development philosophy. Tests should be added for any new use case. Always ask before messing with the tests.
2. We will follow a red,green, refactor workflow. Any code addition should be limited to the minimum needed to pass the test. No extra features.
2. This project also follows an Hexagonal design architecture.
